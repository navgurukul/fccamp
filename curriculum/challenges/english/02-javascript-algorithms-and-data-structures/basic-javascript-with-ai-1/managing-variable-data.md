Objective: To explore about Variables in JavaScript

Introduction: Imagine you're organizing a game where you need to keep track of players' scores, ages, or even their names. How do you store and update this information? That's where variables come into play! Variables are like labeled boxes that store different pieces of information, such as numbers, text, or even more complex data. The best part? You can change whatâ€™s inside these boxes anytime, making your code adaptable and dynamic.
