It’s certainly possible to manage your project’s dependencies yourself. However, as your project grows, this can become a tough task.
This is where a package manager like npm comes in. npm solves this problem by handling dependency and package management for your project. 
You define all your project’s dependencies inside your package.json file. Anytime you or a team member needs to get started with your project, all they have to do is run npm install.
This will immediately install all the necessary dependencies for your project. In the package.json file, you can also specify which versions your project depends upon. This is useful to prevent updates from these packages from breaking your project.
