In your first programming class, you probably learned about compilers. Here's how they work: You write your program in a human-readable format, but computers can't understand it directly. So, you use a compiler to translate your program into a format that computers can read. This translated version of your program can then be run on a computer.

When you write code, you use a high-level language that's easy for humans to understand. The compiler translates this high-level code into low-level machine code, which consists of instructions that the computer's processor can execute. This machine code is what actually gets executed when you run your program.

Compilers are complex programs that bridge the gap between human-readable code and machine-readable code. They take your source code and generate executable code that can be run on a computer. Without compilers, writing software would be much more difficult, as programmers would have to write in machine code directly, which is very tedious and error-prone.

Apne pehle programming class mein, aap shayad compilers ke baare mein seekha hoga. Yahaan par ye hai ki compilers kaise kaam karte hain: Aap apne program ko ek human-readable format mein likhte hain, lekin computers ise seedhe taur par samajh nahi sakte. Isliye, aap ek compiler ka istemal karte hain apne program ko ek format mein translate karne ke liye jo computers padh sakte hain. Is translate ki gayi version of your program phir ek computer par chalayi ja sakti hai.

Jab aap code likhte hain, aap ek high-level language ka istemal karte hain jo insaano ke liye samajhne mein aasan hoti hai. Compiler is high-level code ko translate karta hai low-level machine code mein, jo instructions se milta hai jo computer ka processor execute kar sakta hai. Ye machine code hi wo hai jo sach mein chalaya jaata hai jab aap apna program chalate hain.

Compilers complex programs hote hain jo human-readable code aur machine-readable code ke beech ka fasla karte hain. Ye aapke source code ko lekar executable code generate karte hain jo ek computer par chalaya ja sakta hai. Bina compilers ke, software likhna kaafi mushkil hota, kyun ki programmers ko seedhe machine code mein likhna padta, jo ki bahut hi tedious aur error-prone hota hai.
