Learning how to program is really important. It's like going to law school, not because everyone should become a lawyer, but because it teaches a certain way of thinking. Programming is similar—it teaches how to think in a different way.

Computer science is a liberal art, something everyone should learn. It's like taking a course for a year to learn how to program. Programming is when telling the computer what to do, like playing games or converting numbers.

Understanding how computers work gives a sense of what they can and can't do. There are many interesting jobs in programming, and more of it should be in the curriculum, though maybe not as important as math or literacy.

Programming isn't just for nerds; it's for anyone who wants to create something new. When started, didn't know would love it so much. It's like creating something from scratch, and can be really fun and rewarding.

Learning to program teaches how to think, imagine, and create. It gives a better understanding of the world and is a great foundation for life. It's not just about telling computers what to do; it's also about communicating with the team to accomplish amazing things together.

Programming sikhna sach mein bahut mahatvapurn hai. Ye kisi vakeel banne ke liye nahi hai, balki ye ek khaas tarah ka sochne ka tareeka sikhata hai. Programming ke tarah—ye ek alag tareeke se sochne ka tareeka sikhata hai.

Computer science ek mukt kala hai, kuch aisa jo har koi sikhna chahiye. Ye ek saal ka course karne ki tarah hai jisme programming sikhayi jaati hai. Programming ka matlab hai computer ko batana ki kya karna hai, jaise ki games khelna ya numbers ko convert karna.

Computers kaam kaise karte hain ye samajhna ek aisa mehsoos dilata hai ki wo kya kar sakte hain aur kya nahi. Programming mein kai dilchasp naukriyan hain, aur ise curriculam mein shamil karna chahiye, haalaanki shayad math ya literacy ki tarah mahatvapurn nahi hai.

Programming sirf geeks ke liye nahi hai; ye un logon ke liye hai jo kuch naya banane ka ichha rakhte hain. Jab maine shuru kiya, mujhe yakeen nahi tha ki mujhe itna pasand aayega. Ye kisi cheez ko shuru se banaane jaisa hai, aur sach mein mazedaar aur puri karne waali anubhav hai.

Programming sikhna sikhata hai kaise sochna, kalpana karna, aur rachna karna. Ye duniya ko behtar samajhne mein madad karta hai aur jeevan ke liye ek mahan aadhar hai. Ye sirf computers ko batana nahi hai ki kya karna hai; balki ye sath mil kar kamaal ke kaam karne ke liye team ke saath communicate karna bhi hai.
