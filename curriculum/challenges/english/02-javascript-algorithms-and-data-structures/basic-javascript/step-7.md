Learning about compilers and interpreters helps you understand how computers process languages like English and Hindi. Computers only understand machine language, so we use programming languages like C++ and Java to write instructions that computers can understand. These languages convert human-readable code into machine language using compilers and interpreters. This process helps us communicate with computers and create software.

Compilers and interpreters are essential tools in the world of programming. They both serve the purpose of translating high-level programming languages into machine code that computers can understand, but they do it in different ways.

A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before executing it. It reads the entire source code, checks for errors, and translates it into an executable file. This file can then be run multiple times without needing to be recompiled, making it efficient for larger programs.

On the other hand, an interpreter translates the source code line by line, executing each line as it is translated. This means that an interpreter can immediately show errors in the code, but it can be slower than a compiler since it has to translate the code every time it is run.

Both compilers and interpreters play crucial roles in the development and execution of software, making it possible for programmers to write code in high-level languages and have it run on computers effectively.

Compilers aur interpreters ke baare mein seekhna aapko samajhne mein madad karta hai ki computers English aur Hindi jaise languages ko kaise process karte hain. Computers sirf machine language ko samajh sakte hain, isliye hum programming languages jaise C++ aur Java ka istemal karte hain jo instructions likhne mein computers ko samajhne mein madad karte hain. Ye languages compilers aur interpreters ka istemal karke human-readable code ko machine language mein convert karte hain. Ye process hume computers ke saath communicate karne aur software banane mein madad karta hai.

Compilers aur interpreters programming ki duniya mein mahatvapurn tools hote hain. Dono hi high-level programming languages ko machine code mein translate karne ka kaam karte hain jo computers samajh sakte hain, lekin ye alag tareeke se karte hain.

Ek compiler poori program ko machine code mein translate karta hai use execute karne se pehle. Ye poori source code ko padhta hai, errors ke liye check karta hai, aur use ek executable file mein translate karta hai. Ye file phir baar baar chalayi ja sakti hai bina dobara compile kiye, jo bade programs ke liye efficient hota hai.

Dusri taraf, ek interpreter source code ko line by line translate karta hai, aur har line ko translate karte samay execute karta hai. Iska matlab hai ki ek interpreter turant code mein errors dikhane mein saksham hota hai, lekin ye compiler se thoda dheela ho sakta hai kyun ki har baar jab ye chalta hai to code ko translate karna hota hai.

Dono compilers aur interpreters software ka vikas aur execute karne mein mahatvapurn bhumika nibhate hain, jo programmers ko high-level languages mein code likhne aur use computers par prabhavi tareeke se chalane ki anumati dete hain.

What should be the answer of the following questions? 

1. Takes all the code at one time process it and gives final output.
2. Takes one instruction at a time process it generate output, then takes second instruction and so on
3. Error found at one step stops execution from that point.
4. Error found at one step program wonâ€™t execute
