Computers are electronic devices that process information using ones and zeros. They consist of hardware (physical components like monitors and keyboards) and software (instructions like web browsers and word processors). Personal computers, like desktops and laptops, run on operating systems like Windows, macOS, or Chrome OS. Other devices, like smartphones and appliances, also have built-in computers. Servers send information over networks, such as delivering web pages and sharing files. Computers are essential in our modern world, shaping how we live and work.
