Relational operators are symbols used in programming languages to compare the relationship between two values. They are often used in conditional statements to make decisions based on whether certain conditions are true or false. 

# Comparison Operators in JavaScript

- **Greater than (>):** Imagine you are playing a racing game and your car has a value of 7. Your opponent's car has a value of 5. You can use the greater than operator (>) to see if your car won the race. In this case, 7 > 5 (True), so your car won!

- **Less than (<):** Pretend you are baking cookies and the recipe calls for 4 cups of flour. You only have 3 cups of flour. You can use the less than operator (<) to see if you have enough flour. In this case, 4 < 5 (True), so you have enough flour to bake your cookies!

- **Greater than or equal to (>=):** You are climbing a mountain and you need to reach an altitude of at least 6,000 feet to reach the peak. Your altimeter shows that you are currently at 6,500 feet. You can use the greater than or equal to operator (>=) to see if you have reached the peak. In this case, 6,500 >= 6,000 (True), so you have reached the peak!

- **Less than or equal to (<=):** You are going to a party and your mom says you have to be home by 10 o'clock. You look at your watch and it shows 9:45. You can use the less than or equal to operator (<=) to see if it is past your curfew. In this case, 9:45 <= 10 (True), so it is not past your curfew yet.

- **Equal to (==):** You are collecting baseball cards and you are looking for a specific card. The card you are looking for has a player number of 55. You find a card that has a player number of 55. You can use the equal to operator (==) to see if it is the card you are looking for. In this case, 55 == 55 (True), so you found the card you were looking for!

- **Not equal to (!=):** You are helping your friend set the combination for their new bike lock. The combination is not supposed to be 4, 1, and 5. You accidentally set the combination to 4, 1, and 5. You can use the not equal to operator (!=) to see if the combination is correct. In this case, 4, 1, 5 != correct combination (True), so the combination is not correct.

Relational operators programming languages mein do values ke beech sambandh tulanatmak rup se karne ke liye prayukt prateek hote hain. Ye aksar shartee vakyon mein istemal kiye jate hain taki nirnay liya ja sake ki kya kuch shart sahi ya galat hai.
# JavaScript mein Tulna Operators

- **Bade (>):** Sochiye aap ek racing game khel rahe hain aur aapki car ki keemat 7 hai. Aapke competitor ki car ki keemat 5 hai. Aap bade hone wale operator (>) ka istemal karke dekh sakte hain ki kya aapki car ne race jeeti hai. Is case mein, 7 > 5 (Sach), toh aapki car ne race jeeti!

- **Chhote (<):** Samjhein aap cookies bake kar rahe hain aur recipe mein 4 cup maida manga gaya hai. Aapke paas sirf 3 cup maida hai. Aap chhote hone wale operator (<) ka istemal karke dekh sakte hain ki kya aapke paas maida paryapt hai. Is case mein, 4 < 5 (Sach), toh aapke paas cookies bake karne ke liye paryapt maida hai!

- **Bada ya barabar (>=):** Samjhein aap ek pahaad chad rahe hain aur aapko choti se kam se kam 6,000 feet ki unchai tak pahunchne ki zarurat hai. Aapka altimeter dikhata hai ki aap abhi 6,500 feet ki unchai par hain. Aap bada ya barabar hone wale operator (>=) ka istemal karke dekh sakte hain ki kya aap pahaad ke shikhar par pahunch chuke hain. Is case mein, 6,500 >= 6,000 (Sach), toh aapne pahaad ke shikhar par pahunch liya hai!

- **Chhota ya barabar (<=):** Samjhein aap ek party mein ja rahe hain aur aapki maa kehti hai ki aapko 10 baje tak ghar pahuchna hai. Aap apni ghadi dekhte hain aur woh 9:45 dikhata hai. Aap chhota ya barabar hone wale operator (<=) ka istemal karke dekh sakte hain ki kya aapka curfew time guzar chuka hai. Is case mein, 9:45 <= 10 (Sach), toh aapka curfew time abhi tak nahi guzra hai.

- **Barabar (==):** Samjhein aap baseball cards collect kar rahe hain aur aap ek khaas card dhoondh rahe hain. Woh card jise aap dhoondh rahe hain uska player number 55 hai. Aap ek card dhoondhte hain jiska player number 55 hai. Aap barabar hone wale operator (==) ka istemal karke dekh sakte hain ki kya yeh wahi card hai jise aap dhoondh rahe hain. Is case mein, 55 == 55 (Sach), toh aapne wahi card dhoondh liya hai jise aap dhoondh rahe the!

**Barabar nahi (!=):** Samjhein aap apne dost ki nayi bike lock ke combination set karne mein madad kar rahe hain. Combination 4, 1, aur 5 nahi honi chahiye. Aap galti se combination ko 4, 1, aur 5 set kar dete hain. Aap barabar nahi hone wale operator (!=) ka istemal karke dekh sakte hain ki kya combination sahi hai. Is case mein, 4, 1, 5 != correct combination (Sach), toh combination galat hai.
