# --description--
Programming is like giving instructions to a computer. It's how we tell computers what to do, like playing a game or showing a website. Coding is the actual writing of these instructions in a language the computer understands.

Imagine you're baking a cake. The recipe is like a program, and following the recipe is like coding. You need to be clear and specific in your instructions, just like in coding.

Computers are really good at following instructions, but they can't think for themselves. So, we have to be careful and precise when we write code.

Learning to code is fun and useful. It's like learning a new language that lets you create all sorts of cool things, from websites to games. Plus, it's a skill that can open up many exciting opportunities in the future!

Programming ek tarah se computer ko instructions dene jaisa hai. Ye hai hamara tareeka computer ko batane ka ki kya karna hai, jaise ki kisi game ko khelna ya website ko dikhana. Coding actual mein ye instructions likhna hai ek aise bhasha mein jo computer samajh sake.

Imagine karo ki aap cake bana rahe hain. Recipe ek program ki tarah hai, aur us recipe ko follow karna coding ki tarah hai. Aapko apne instructions mein spasht aur vishesh hona chahiye, jaise coding mein hota hai.

Computers instructions ko follow karne mein bahut acche hote hain, lekin khud soch nahi sakte. Isliye, jab hum code likhte hain, hume savdhan aur nishpaksh hona chahiye.

Coding sikhna mazedaar aur upyogi hai. Ye ek aise nayi bhasha sikhne jaisa hai jo aapko websites se lekar games tak ke kai cool cheezein banane ki anumati deti hai. Aur iske alawa, ye ek skill hai jo bhavishya mein kai dilchasp mauke kholti hai!
