A programming language is a way to tell a computer what to do. For example, if you want the computer to count to five, you need to use a programming language to give it the right instructions.

Programming languages are made up of symbols that represent specific instructions for the computer. These symbols are combined to create a computer program, which is a set of instructions for the computer to follow.

While learning to code, you'll need to understand basic concepts that apply to all programming languages. Some languages, like JavaScript, are used for making websites interactive, while others like Python and C++ are better for writing algorithms and storage systems.

There's no right or wrong language to start with. The most important thing is to learn the basic concepts of programming, which will help you code in any situation.

Ek programming language ek tareeka hai computer ko batane ka ki kya karna hai. For example, agar aap chahte hain ki computer panch tak ginti kare, to aapko ek programming language ka istemal karke use sahi instructions deni hogi.

Programming languages symbols se bani hoti hain jo computer ke liye khaas instructions ko represent karte hain. Ye symbols milakar ek computer program banate hain, jo computer ko follow karne ke liye instructions ka set hota hai.

Coding sikhate samay, aapko un basic concepts ko samajhna hoga jo sabhi programming languages mein lagu hote hain. Kuch languages, jaise JavaScript, websites ko interactive banane ke liye istemal hoti hain, jabki doosri languages, jaise Python aur C++, algorithms aur storage systems likhne ke liye behtar hoti hain.

Shuruwat karne ke liye koi sahi ya galat language nahi hai. Sabse mahatvapurn baat hai ki aap programming ke basic concepts ko samjhein, jo aapko kisi bhi situation mein code likhne mein madad karenge.
