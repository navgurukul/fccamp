# --description--

**Objective:**
We'll analyze the feedback from our previous research to identify areas where we can improve our understanding of objects in JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
**Introduction:**
Hey coders! Remember that epic objects research we crushed with AI? Now it's time to level up! We just received some awesome feedback (check your inbox) that'll help us become true object masters.

Here's the plan: We'll use that feedback and the included exploration questions (like a secret decoder ring!) to build an even deeper understanding of objects. Think of it as cracking the objects code with AI as our best friend and guide!

**Some questions to add in your research**
Why do we need objects in programming?
<br>
What problems do objects solve in programming?
<br>
How do objects help in organizing and managing data?
<br>
Can you give real-world examples where objects are useful?
<br>
How do objects promote code reusability and maintainability?
<br>
How do objects facilitate encapsulation and abstraction?
<br>
What are objects and how do you work with them?
<br>
What is the basic structure of an object in JavaScript?
<br>
How do objects store data using key-value pairs?
<br>
What are the properties and methods of an object?
<br>
How do you create and initialize objects in JavaScript using object literal notation?
<br>
How do you access object properties and methods using dot notation and bracket notation?
<br>
How do you add, modify, or delete properties and methods of an existing object?
<br>
What is the for-in loop, and how do you loop over object properties?
<br>
How do you check whether an object has a specific property?
