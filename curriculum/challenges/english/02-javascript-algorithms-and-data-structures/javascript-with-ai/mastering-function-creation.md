# --description--

**Objective:**
To explore the concept of functions in JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
**Introduction:**
Imagine you're baking a cake. Every time you bake, you follow a specific set of steps, like mixing ingredients, preheating the oven, and setting the timer. What if you could write these steps d	own once and reuse them whenever you want to bake? In programming, that's exactly what functions do! Functions are like recipes that you can create and call upon whenever needed. They help you organize your code, make it reusable, and ensure it runs smoothly. Functions allow you to define specific tasks and execute them with ease, making your code more efficient and modular.
