**Objective:**
To deepen our understanding of strings in JavaScript by analyzing feedback and exploring new insights.
<br>
<br>
**Introduction:**
Hey coders! Remember that epic strings research we crushed with AI? Now it's time to level up! We just received some awesome feedback that’ll help us become true masters of string manipulation.

Here’s the plan: We’ll use that feedback and tackle a series of insightful exploration questions (like a secret decoder ring!) to build an even deeper understanding of strings. Think of it as cracking the strings code with AI as our best friend and guide!

**Some questions to add in your research**
Why are strings important in programming?
<br>
What problems do strings solve in programming?
<br>
How do strings help in organizing and managing text data?
<br>
Can you give real-world examples where strings are useful?

Why are strings called strings?
<br>
How many ways are there to represent a string in JavaScript?
