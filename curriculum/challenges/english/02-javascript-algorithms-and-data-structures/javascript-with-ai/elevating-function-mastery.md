# --description--

**Objective:**
To analyze feedback and deepen our understanding of functions in JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
**Introduction:**
Hey coders! Remember that epic functions research we crushed with AI? Now it's time to level up! We just received some awesome feedback that’ll help us become true function masters.

Here's the plan: We’ll use that feedback and the included exploration questions (like a secret decoder ring!) to build an even deeper understanding of functions. Think of it as cracking the functions code with AI as our best friend and guide!

**Some questions to add in your research**
Why Functions?
<br>
-Exploring the necessity and advantages of using functions in programming.
-Understanding how functions solve problems, promote code reusability, and enhance maintainability.
<br>
Function Invocation:
<br>
a. Basics of function invocation:
<br>
Writing basic functions in JavaScript.
<br>
Understanding arguments and parameters and their distinction.
<br>
Explaining function invocation with and without arguments.
<br>
Delving into default parameters and their functionality.
<br>
b. Return Statement:
<br>
Discussing the role and importance of the return statement.
<br>
Contrasting return statements with console.log().
<br>
Handling multiple return statements and scenarios where no return statement is provided.
<br>
Function as a Variable:
<br>
-Understanding functions as variables, including assignment, passing as arguments, and returning from other functions.
<br>
Arrow and Anonymous Functions:
<br>
a. Introduction to arrow and anonymous functions:
<br>
Defining anonymous and arrow functions and their syntax.
<br>
Highlighting the benefits and limitations of arrow functions compared to regular functions.
<br>
b. Function Expression:
<br>
Explaining function expressions and their differences from function declarations.
<br>
Identifying scenarios and benefits of using function expressions.
