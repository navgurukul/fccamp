# --description--

**Objective:**
To explore JavaScript Objects.
<br>
<br>
**Introduction:**
Picture you're creating a digital address book where each entry needs to store multiple details, like a name, phone number, and address. How do you group this related information together? That's where objects come into play! Objects in JavaScript are like containers that hold various pieces of data, organized by key-value pairs. The best part? These keys allow you to access and modify the data efficiently, making your programs more structured and intuitive.
