# --description--

**Introduction:**
Imagine you have a perfectly round pizza, and you want to measure the distance around its edge to order the right amount of crust. In geometry, this distance is known as the circumference. To calculate it, we use the formula C=2πrC=2πr, where rr is the radius of the circle. In JavaScript, the Math object provides us with Math.PI, a constant that represents the value of π (Pi). By combining Math.PI with the radius, we can easily find the circumference of any circle.

**Challenge:**
Your challenge is to write a function getCircumference that takes the radius (in cm) of a circle as an argument and returns its circumference. Use Math.PI to calculate the result. Finally, print the circumference.

# --hints--

You should use `typeof()`  in your code to check Data Type.

```js
assert(code.match(/typeof/g));
```

`checkDataType(67)` should return `number`

```js
assert(checkDataType(67)==="number")
```

`checkDataType("Hello")` should return `string`

```js
assert(checkDataType("Hello")==="string")
```
