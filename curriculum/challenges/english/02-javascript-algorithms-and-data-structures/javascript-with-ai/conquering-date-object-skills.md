**Objective:**
To explore and deepen our understanding of the Date object in JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
**Introduction:**
Hey coders! Remember that epic Date object research we crushed with AI? Now it's time to level up! We just received some awesome feedback (check your inbox) that'll help us become true Date object masters.

Here's the plan: We'll use that feedback and the included exploration questions (like a secret decoder ring!) to build an even deeper understanding of the Date object. Think of it as cracking the Date object code with AI as our best friend and guide!

**Some questions to add in your research**
What is a Date Object and why do we need it?
<br>
Understanding the purpose and necessity of the Date object.
<br>
How does the Date object manage time and date in JavaScript?
<br>
How does the Date object address time-related tasks?
<br>
Exploring the functionality of the Date object in handling date and time-related operations.
<br>
What are the basics of using the Date object?
<br>
Creating Date objects and utilizing their methods.
<br>
Explaining properties and methods of the Date object.
<br>
What are common mistakes and misconceptions with the Date object?
<br>
Identifying errors such as incorrect formats when parsing date strings and improper usage of date formatting methods.
