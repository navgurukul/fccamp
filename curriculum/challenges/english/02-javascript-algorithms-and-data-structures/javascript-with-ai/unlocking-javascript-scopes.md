# --description--

**Objective:**
To deepen our understanding of scopes in JavaScript through exploration and feedback analysis.
<br>
<br>
**Introduction:**
Hey coders! Remember that epic scopes research we crushed with AI? Now it's time to level up! We just received some awesome feedback that'll help us become true scopes masters.

Here's the plan: We'll use that feedback and the included exploration questions (like a secret decoder ring!) to build an even deeper understanding of scopes. Think of it as cracking the scopes code with AI as our best friend and guide!

AI will be by our side, providing valuable insights and explanations to help us truly grasp even the trickiest scopes concepts.

**Some questions to add in your research**
Why is understanding scope important in programming?
<br>
What is the concept of scope in programming?
<br>
How does scope affect variable accessibility and visibility?
<br>
What problems do scopes solve in programming?
<br>
Can you give real-world examples where scope is important?
<br>
What are the different types of scopes in JavaScript?
<br>
How do global and local scopes differ in JavaScript?
<br>
What is block scope, and how is it implemented in JavaScript?
<br>
How does the use of let and const affect variable scope in JavaScript?
<br>
Explain the concept of function scope in JavaScript.
<br>
How does JavaScript handle nested scopes?
<br>
What is the difference between scope and context in JavaScript?
<br>
How do closures relate to scope in JavaScript?
<br>
What is the "this" keyword, and how does it relate to scope?
<br>
Identify common mistakes related to variable scope in JavaScript and how to avoid them.
