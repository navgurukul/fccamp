**Objective:**
To explore the concept of Scopes in JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
**Introduction:**
Imagine you’re building a multi-level game where different levels have their own set of rules and environments. In coding terms, these levels are like scopes, which define where variables can be accessed and modified. Scopes help you organize your code by limiting the visibility and lifetime of variables, ensuring that your variables don’t accidentally interfere with each other. By mastering scopes, you’ll be able to write more efficient and error-free code, keeping your program's logic clear and manageable.
